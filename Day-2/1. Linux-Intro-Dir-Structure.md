# Day 2: Introduction to Linux  

## 1. What is Linux?  
Linux is an **open-source operating system** based on Unix, widely used for servers, cloud computing, and embedded systems.

### Key Features:  
âœ” **Operating System:** Manages hardware and software resources.  
âœ” **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and distribute.  
âœ” **Developed in 1991** by **Linus Torvalds**.  
âœ” **Multi-User & Multi-Tasking:** Supports multiple users and processes simultaneously.  
âœ” **Case Sensitive:** Treats uppercase and lowercase differently (`File.txt` â‰  `file.txt`).

## 2. Linux Distributions (Flavors)  
A **distribution (distro)** is a customized version of Linux that includes the OS, package management, and additional tools.

| **Distro**   | **Use Case**                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **RedHat**  | Enterprise-grade, commercial support (RHEL)      |
| **Ubuntu**  | User-friendly, widely used for desktops/servers  |
| **CentOS**  | Community-supported version of RedHat           |
| **Debian**  | Stable, known for reliability                   |
| **SUSE Linux** | Enterprise use, strong in SAP environments  |

Other distros: Fedora, Arch Linux, Kali Linux (for penetration testing), etc.

## 3. Linux Directory Structure  
Linux follows a hierarchical directory structure where everything starts from **`/` (root directory)**.

### **Key Directories Explained**
- **`/` (Root Directory):** The top-most directory that contains all files and subdirectories.  

- **`/bin`** - : Contains essential command-line executable files (binaries) that are available to all users.

- **`/boot`** - : Contains files related to the boot process, including the Linux kernel, initial ramdisk (initrd), and bootloader configuration.

- **`/dev`** - : Contains device files that represent and allow access to various hardware devices on the system.

- **`/etc`** - : Contains system-wide configuration files for various applications and services.

- **`/home`** - : The home directories for individual users. Each user typically has a subdirectory here to store their personal files and settings.

- **`/lab and /lib64`** - : These directories contain shared libraries needed by the system and applications. The "lib64" directory is present on 64-bit systems.

- **`/media`** - : Mount point for removable media devices such as USB drives or optical discs.

- **`/mnt`** - : A general-purpose mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.

- **`/opt`** - : Contains optional software packages installed on the system. Applications installed here are often self-contained in their own directories.

- **`/proc`** - : A virtual filesystem that provides information about processes and system status. It is used by many system utilities to obtain runtime information.

- **`/root`** - : The home directory for the root user, the administrative superuser.

- **`/run`** - : A temporary filesystem that contains runtime data for various system services. It is cleared on each reboot.

- **`/sbin`** - : Contains system binaries (executable files) that are primarily used by the root user for system administration tasks.

- **`/srv`** - : Contains data for services provided by the system.

- **`/sys`** - : A virtual filesystem that exposes kernel-related information and configuration.

- **`/tmp`** -  A directory for temporary files created by applications and users. Its contents are typically cleared on each reboot.

- **`/usr`** - : Contains user-related programs, libraries, documentation, and shared resources. It has subdirectories such as /usr/bin for user binaries, /usr/lib for libraries, and /usr/share for shared data.

- **`/var`** - : Contains variable data that changes during the system's operation, such as logs, databases, and spool files.

This is a high-level overview of the Ubuntu Linux folder structure. Each directory serves a specific purpose in organizing the system's files and resources.

# ðŸ“Œ Linux Interview Questions (IQ)

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is the difference between `/bin` and `/sbin`?

### ðŸ“Œ `/bin` (Binary Executables)
- Contains **basic commands** that are **available to all users**.
- These commands are essential for basic system operations.
- Located in **`/bin`**, meaning they can be executed without requiring superuser privileges.

**âœ… Examples:**
- `ls` - List directory contents.
- `cat` - View file contents.
- `cp` - Copy files.
- `mv` - Move or rename files.
- `rm` - Remove files.

### ðŸ“Œ `/sbin` (System Binaries)
- Contains **system administration commands**, primarily used by the **root user**.
- These commands are used for system maintenance and management.
- Located in **`/sbin`**, requiring **root privileges** (`sudo`) for execution.

**âœ… Examples:**
- `shutdown` - Power off the system.
- `reboot` - Restart the system.
- `ifconfig` - Configure network interfaces.
- `mount` - Mount filesystems.
- `fsck` - File system consistency check.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. In which directory are all external software packages installed?

### ðŸ“Œ Answer: **`/opt`**  
- The **`/opt`** directory is used to store **optional (third-party) software**.
- This includes **software not part of the default Linux distribution**.
- Typically used for **commercial software, large applications, or manually installed packages**.

**âœ… Examples of software stored in `/opt`:**
- Google Chrome (`/opt/google/chrome`)
- VirtualBox (`/opt/VirtualBox`)
- Custom enterprise applications

**ðŸ’¡ Why `/opt`?**
- Keeps the system clean by separating **non-default software** from system files.
- Avoids conflicts with **default Linux package manager installations (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`)**.
- Easier to manage, upgrade, and remove third-party applications.

### ðŸ“Œ Summary
| **Directory** | **Purpose** | **Access Level** | **Examples** |
|--------------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| `/bin` | Essential user commands | All users | `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` |
| `/sbin` | System administration commands | Root user (sudo required) | `shutdown`, `reboot`, `mount` |
| `/opt` | External software packages | Varies (depends on software) | Google Chrome, VirtualBox |
