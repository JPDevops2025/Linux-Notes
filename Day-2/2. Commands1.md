# üìå Linux Commands Guide  


## üîπ What is a Command?

In Linux, a **command** is an instruction given to the shell (like `bash`) to perform a specific action. These actions can include managing files, installing software, monitoring system status, and more.

Commands are typed into a **terminal** or shell prompt and executed by the operating system.

## üìê Command Syntax

```
command [options] [arguments]
```

- **command**: The name of the tool or utility (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`)
- **options**: Flags that modify the behavior of the command (e.g., `-l`, `--help`)
- **arguments**: Targets like files, directories, usernames, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Command Examples

### 1. List files in a directory
```bash
ls -l /home/ec2-user
```
- `ls`: List directory contents
- `-l`: Use a long listing format
- `/home/ec2-user`: Directory to list

---

### 2. Copy a file to another location
```bash
cp report.txt /backup/
```
- `cp`: Copy command
- `report.txt`: File to copy
- `/backup/`: Destination directory

---

### 3. Print the current working directory
```bash
pwd
```
- `pwd`: Displays the full path of your current directory

---

### 4. Display the contents of a file
```bash
cat file.txt
```
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents

## üìä How Commands Work Internally

When you type a command:
1. The **shell** reads your input.
2. It looks for the command binary in directories listed in the `$PATH` variable.
3. The binary is executed with the specified options and arguments.
4. Output is displayed via standard output (stdout) or error stream (stderr).

---

## üìÅ Where Commands Live

Common system command paths:
- `/bin`
- `/usr/bin`
- `/sbin`
- `/usr/sbin`

You can check the path of a command using:
```bash
which ls
```
